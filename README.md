# Hotel-SQL

This is My first SQL database project which I learnt how to use and create SQL databases and how to connect all tables together.
I have 5 views in this project.
in this project I am trying to connect all the tables to the Hotel_info table and connect all the informations of Travellerts to the Customer_info Table.
